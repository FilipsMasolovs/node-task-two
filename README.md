# Node.js + Express.js education

A slightly more advanced version of the Comments app.\
Unlike its predecessor this app actually stores the comments in the /middleware/comments.json file\
It uses such default Node.js functionality like `fs` and `path`\
And on top of that some Express.js functionality like `router` and `static`

The code is definitely not optimal as I am just getting the hang of BE -> FE interactions. Feel free to submit pull requests, issues...

## Quick Start

Firstly download and unzip the project or git clone it to your desired destination.\
Then follow these steps:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Serve on localhost:5000
npm run dev
```
